## 🚀 How to contribute

Clone it. Run it. Cry a little. Here's how:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sync-pad.git
cd sync-pad
npm install
npm run dev
\\ for frontend
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
⚠️ Note: You'll need an OpenAI API key. Keep it secret, keep it safe.

### Create a .env file in the root directory:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

## 🤯 Why Though?
Because writing tools are boring.
Sync-Pad makes editing fun, judgmental, and painfully honest — just like your high school English teacher, but cooler.
